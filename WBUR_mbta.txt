But first, the news:
WeÕre barely midway through February, but the MBTA is giving riders time to mentally prepare for another round of service disruptions coming in March (as promised). TheyÕll touch the Red, Orange and Green lines on both weekends and weeknights, as well as the Mattapan trolley and commuter rail. HereÕs a look:
The Red Line: Shuttle buses will replace trains between Harvard and JFK/UMass during the weekends of March 4-5 and March 25-26 so crews can install a new digital signal system.
* The free Red Line shuttles will stop at all affected stations, except Park Street and Downtown Crossing. Instead, theyÕll stop at nearby Haymarket and State stations.
* Shuttles will also greet riders between Braintree and North Quincy stations starting at 9 p.m. each night March 20-23.
The Orange Line: Train service will be suspended between Ruggles and North Station on the weekend of March 11-12 due to track work and the Government Center Garage demolition.
* The TÕs advice: take the Green Line instead. ThereÕll also be shuttles running back and forth between Ruggles and Copley.
* Shuttles will also step in for trains between Wellington and North Stations each nightÊMarch 27-30, starting at 9 p.m.
The Green Line: Shuttle buses will replace trolleys between North Station and Government Center Station on the weekend ofÊMarch 11-12 due to the aforementioned garage project.
The Mattapan trolley: Shuttles will replace the full line each night March 6-9 starting at 9 p.m. so crews can Òremove a staircase at Milton Station.Ó
The commuter rail: ThereÕll be two different nine-day shuttle diversions. The first is March 4-12 on the Haverhill line between Haverhill and Reading stations. And the second is March 20-28 on the Newburyport/Rockport line between Swampscott and North Station.
* During both of those diversions, the T will install a new safety system on the lines. No bikes are allowed on any of the shuttle buses, and the T still expects riders to pay commuter rail fares.
Cheers! Since things tend to get busy around here on St. PatrickÕs Day weekend, the T wonÕt have any shutdowns on March 18-19.
Remember: this is all in addition to this monthÕsÊslate of weekend diversions. These types of partial-line shutdowns are expected to continue for many more months.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has officially put her rent control plan onÊthe agenda. After WuÊfiled it this week,Êthe Boston City Council will take up the proposal during its meeting today. While the plan faces what will likely beÊa steeper challengeÊon Beacon Hill, the 13-member council could prove to be a hurdle in its own right.
* WuÊmade the case onÊRadio BostonÊlast monthÊthat her proposal tries to prevent existing renters from being forced out by rent hikes, without discouraging development.
* However, thereÕsÊcriticism from both sides. As the Boston HeraldÊreported, at least three progressive councilors expressed concerns that WuÕs plan doesnÕt do enough. At the same time, at least two more conservative councilors fear that Ñ as the real estate industry argues Ñ it would deter growth.
* Go deeper: Due toÊa number of exemptions in the policy, WBURÕs Walter Wuthmann reports it would only cover about 55% of BostonÕs rental units.
* WhatÕs next: WuÊconceded Tuesday on GBHÊthat itÕs ÒpossibleÓ her plan doesnÕt get past the Council. But before there are any votes or amendments, councilors will likely refer her proposal for a future public hearing.
Look up! No, thatÊwasnÕt a UFOÊabove Boston last night. TheÊtrain of lightsÊthat many residents have spotted in the night sky throughout the week are, in fact, SpaceXÕs Starlink satellites. (There are over 3,500 in orbit as part ofÊthe global internet initiative.)
* Check out the rough scheduleÊfor when the unique sight will be visible from Boston. YourÊnextÊbest chance is tonight around 6:45 p.m.,Êlooking west.
P.S.Ñ We have some unseasonably warm weather carrying us into the weekend. Looking to get outside? HereÕsÊa great Twitter thread of scenic Greater Boston biking loopsÊto try now or
