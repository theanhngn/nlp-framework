Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey is promising swift action Friday after another issue on the Green Line that gave her a taste of the dysfunction on the MBTA that plagued her predecessor. ÒItÕs really frustrating for people,Ó Healey said. ÒIt is absolutely frustrating.ÓThe MBTA said the Green Line experienced a "signal problem at Copley Junction" on Thursday night, which trapped passengers on trains underground and forced the use of buses for service on a section of the busy line.However, Boston fire officials said there may have been a minor derailment with one wheel possibly coming off the track.When 80 to 100 passengers were trapped underground Thursday night due to what the MBTA called a signal issue, the MBTA called the Boston Fire Department to help to evacuate those passengers through tunnels and out to safety.ÒThatÕs a terrible thing to be on your way home or on your way to work evacuated, led through a dark tunnel,Ó Healey said.Healey said she has prioritized the search for a new general manager of the MBTA.ÒAlso, the appointment of a transportation safety chief so that inspections can be done on our tracks. on our rails, on our buses to make sure we are identifying and fixing problems ahead of time,Ó Healey said.The governor said she's committed to hiring more workers to prevent situations similar to those that happened Thursday night.ÒItÕs scary,Ó Healey said. ÒItÕs absolutely unacceptable, but that's why this administration is committed to addressing that.ÓThe latest incident comes one week after the MBTA said that full deployment of an automated anti-collision system on the Green Line will be delayed by up to 18 months because of the complexity of weaving the technology into the aging trolley network. Anti-collision technology is already in place on the MBTA's heavy rail Red, Orange and Blue Lines and its commuter rail network, but the T has yet to install such a system on the light rail Green Line nearly 14 years after a fatal crash prompted the National Transportation Safety Board to first call on the T to roll out the protection measure."There's no off-the-shelf product that achieves this level of protection for a light rail system like ours, especially one that is part of the oldest subway system in the United States,"Angel Pena, the MBTA's chief of capital transformation, told the T board's safety subcommittee last Thursday.The proposed Green Line Train Protection System will eventually combine three primary features, according to Pena: preventing train-to-train collisions, reining in trolley speeding, and reducing the risk of Green Line operators running red lights on the tracks.It aims to essentially automate braking in emergency situations, bringing a trolley to a stop before it hits another vehicle or when a driver ignores speeding warnings. Equipment would be mounted both along the tracks and on the vehicles themselves.

Signal issue halts some MBTA Green Line service, forces evacuations 
The latest incident comes one week after the MBTA said that full deployment of an automated anti-collision system on the Green Line will be delayed by up to 18 months because of the complexity of weaving the technology into the aging trolley network. 
Anti-collision technology is already in place on the MBTA's heavy rail Red, Orange and Blue Lines and its commuter rail network, but the T has yet to install such a system on the light rail Green Line nearly 14 years after a fatal crash prompted the National Transportation Safety Board to first call on the T to roll out the protection measure.
"There's no off-the-shelf product that achieves this level of protection for a light rail system like ours, especially one that is part of the oldest subway system in the United States,"
Angel Pena, the MBTA's chief of capital transformation, told the T board's safety subcommittee last Thursday.


MBTA's Green Line anti-collision system deployment delayed again 
The proposed Green Line Train Protection System will eventually combine three primary features, according to Pena: preventing train-to-train collisions, reining in trolley speeding, and reducing the risk of Green Line operators running red lights on the tracks.
It aims to essentially automate braking in emergency situations, bringing a trolley to a stop before it hits another vehicle or when a driver ignores speeding warnings. Equipment would be mounted both along the tracks and on the vehicles themselves.
