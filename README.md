# nlp-framework

In this project, me (Anh Nguyen), Nathan Brito, Tung Giang, and Kelly Chen are trying to create a natural language processing framework. We will analyze data in text form about Boston MBTA news (which we scrape online), run it through a parser, then deliver different visualizations (wordcloud and Sankey diagram) to display the most noticeable words in our scraped data. All of the code is written in Python.
