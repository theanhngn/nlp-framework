# NLP Framework: A reusable and extensible natural language processing framework

In this project, me (Anh Nguyen), Nathan Brito, Tung Giang, and Kelly Chen are trying to create a natural language processing framework. We will analyze data in text form about Boston MBTA news (which we scrape online), run it through a parser, then deliver different visualizations (wordcloud and Sankey diagram) to display the most noticeable words in our scraped data. Throughout the project, we tried to implement functional programming to make our products as reusable and extensible as possible. All of the code is written in Python.
